# SONiC can't enable loop-back filter feature
# Test case is skipped, because SONiC does not have a control to adjust loop-back filter settings.
# Default SONiC behavior is to forward the traffic, so loop-back filter does not triggers for IP packets.
# All router interfaces has attribute "sx_interface_attributes_t.loopback_enable" - enabled.
# To enable loop-back filter drops - need to disable that attribute when create RIF.
# To do this can be used SAI attribute SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_LOOPBACK_PACKET_ACTION, which is not exposed to SONiC
