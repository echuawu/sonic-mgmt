"""
This test checks secure upgrade feature. If we have a secure system with secured image installed
on it, the system is expected to install only secured images on it. So trying to install non-secure image
will cause fail and a print of failure message to console indicating it is not a secured image.
This test case validates the error flow mentioned above.

In order to run this test, you need to specify the following argument:

    --target_image_list (to contain one non-secure image path e.g. /tmp/images/my_non_secure_img.bin)
