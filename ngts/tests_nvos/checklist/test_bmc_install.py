    @summary: test all these commands:
        nv show fae platform firmware bmc files
        nv action delete fae platform firmware bmc files <file-name>
        nv action fetch fae platform firmware bmc <remote-url-fetch>
        nv action install fae platform firmware bmc files <file-name> [force]
    Note: because firmware installation takes a long time and the test does it twice, one time it's done
    on NVUE and one time on OpenAPI.

    Note that a single image file contains two images (different versions). Running action-install on the
    file assumes that one of these is already installed, and triggers an installation of the other version.
    That's why this test uses only one file but actually swaps back-and-forth between two firmware versions.

    Test flow:
        Check if it is a Juliet device otherwise finish
        (On NVUE:)
        1. Gets the BMC name and name of currently-installed firmware version
        2. Fetch image file
        3. Assert the file now exists
        4. Install firmware and reboots
        (On OpenAPI:)
        5. Assert that the currently-installed firmware is the expected version
        6. Re-installs the original firmware and reboots
        (On NVUE:)
        7. Assert the current version is now the original version (from step 1)
        8. Delete the image file
        (On OpenAPI:)
        9. Fetch image file
        10. Delete the image file
        11. Assert the file no longer exists
